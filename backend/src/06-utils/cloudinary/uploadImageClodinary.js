/*
Example response from Cloudinary:

{
  "asset_id": "abc123",
  "public_id": "binkeyit/xyz789",
  "version": 1693779990,
  "format": "jpg",
  "resource_type": "image",
  "secure_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1693779990/binkeyit/xyz789.jpg"
}




So basically, this function takes an uploaded image (from frontend, Postman, or file input), uploads it to Cloudinary storage, and returns the uploaded image info (including the URL).
